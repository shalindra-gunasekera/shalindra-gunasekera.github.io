**Purpose**

This repository is to act as a website to showcase and store all my projects and ventures. 
The repository doubles up as a showcase of the webpage design itself. 

Admittedly, I've done very little on this. Most recently this site was converted into a local geoguesser clone for an exhibition event in my Running Club. It is very janky (especially on mobile), but not bad for the first thing I evermade on Java script!

This project was inspired by two portfolio websites I encountered during my university time. The first is Professor Oleg Sushkov's webpage,
which documents all his publications, teaching material, and wholesome news. See his website here: https://opsushkov.squarespace.com/

The second of which was a portfolio website created by the incredible Joe Li. Check that one out here: https://joe-li.com/
