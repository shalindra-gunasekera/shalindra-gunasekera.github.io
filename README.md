**Purpose**
This repository is to act as a website to showcase and store all my projects and ventures. 
The repository doubles up as a showcase of the webpage design itself. 

This project was inspired by two portfolio websites I encountered during my university time. The first is Professor Oleg Sushkov's webpage,
which documents all his publications, teaching material, and wholesome news. See his website here: https://opsushkov.squarespace.com/

The second of which was a portfolio website created by the incredible Joe Lie. Check that one out here: https://joe-li.com/
